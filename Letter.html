            Why do all beautiful things have to come to an end…? Maybe it's because only by ending can their beauty be preserved in time.
<p>
Remember when we started talking back in May? Yeah. It was a heck of a good time. Spending time with you was so much fun, it also felt rather new, and we were nervous because we didn’t know each other that well… yet. We used ChatGPT to come up with random questions and we’d talk as friends.
<p>
Fast forward to the end of May, when we both confessed what we felt for each other. I couldn’t ever wish to be more blessed. Blessed with your love, your care, your affection. Same for you. You were perfect. And you still are. Countless hours with you over call, doing goof ball things meant nothing but fun and fun. Time spent with you was literally the happiest time ever in my life. I felt so safe. So relaxed. So happy. It seemed the more I knew about you, the more I’d fall in love. 
<p>
August. Where we spent the most time, and also most of our time with each other. It was also the first gift I ever gave you. It didn’t take that long, and it didn’t look that great either. But man, the smile and excitement on your face was priceless to me. We had such a good time together.
<p>
September. School started for both of us. It was really the biggest hit on us because we didn’t have a lot of time together anymore. Monday to Friday, were school. And only school. We’d text each other, and it was still so fun talking to you. And it only made weekends so much more precious for us. Watching movies, or having our dates and playing games. We were as happy as I could ask for. 
<p>
A cardboard box filled with love. That was December, right before Christmas. The amount of effort you put in. The amount of time you put in. The amount of thinking you put in. The amount of Love you put in. I can never ask for more. It was literally the best gift I ever had in my entire life. It was beautiful, it meant so much to me. And I still will.
<p>
The end of the fireworks. It doesn’t matter how long the show is, as long as it was once beautiful. Maybe the distance is starting to.. Hit us. I just think it’s too time consuming and it exhausts both of us. And, the cost of having to miss each other was too high. Missing you sucked. Knowing you miss me, also sucked. The emptiness from “i love you” before sleep felt so empty… How much I want us to continue, I don’t want to waste either of our time, and
<p>
Maybe liking someone needs more than seeing each other over camera. Maybe you don’t like who I am. Maybe I don’t actually like who you are. Maybe I don’t know you that well. Maybe you don't know me that well either. I blame myself for putting both of us where we are right now. Maybe I do regret sometimes that I shouldn’t have started all of this, I just didn't know how to tell you. We were stepping into this way too optimistically, it’s a deep deep sea no one should ever come close to. 
<p>
You can blame me, and that's okay. I blame myself too.
<p>
I’m sorry that I couldn’t take you to Taco Bell. But what I can never be more happy about is making you happy, and seeing you smile like you have nothing to worry. Seeing you happy makes me the most happy man alive. That’s something I will never regret.
<p>
I love you Ashley, as a friend, for now. I’m very sorry. I stole your heart, and this is me hoping to give it back. I don’t want you to be sad, but I think it was a pretty heck of a firework show. I can never ask for more. I can never ask for better. It was truly beautiful. 
<p>
I wish us to still be friends. I hope you have a happy life after all. I hope we can still have a lot of fun together. I wish we can still meet up one day in the future, in America.
